# TODO

> **Built by agents, for agents.** We prioritize improvements that create the best possible AI agent experience.

## P2 - Nice to Have

### Test Coverage Gaps
- [ ] Test config priority chain (ENV > ~/.nansen > local) — needs `loadConfig()` exported
- [ ] Add snapshot tests for `--help` output
- [ ] Document magic test addresses (e.g. Binance hot wallet)
- [ ] Test Bitcoin address validation
- [ ] Test stdin pipe mode for API key input

### Shell Completions
- [ ] Bash completions
- [ ] Zsh completions
- [ ] Fish completions

### Distribution
- [ ] Homebrew formula (`brew install nansen-cli`)
- [ ] Docker image
